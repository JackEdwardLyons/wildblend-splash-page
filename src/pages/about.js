            <h2>Zoe Lyons, founder of Wildblend</h2>
            <p>
              As an Iranian-looking half Greek half Austrian who migrated to
              Australia to live and work here with my Australian husband, I'm a
              cultural chameleon. My mixed background is probably one of the
              main reasons why I feel most comfortable when I'm on the road
              working remotely. I've lived and worked in Europe, Australia,
              China and the US over the last 5 years.

                <p>
                  As of now, I am based on the Gold Coast, Australia where I
                  create cookbooks for PaleoHacks. I also produce content,
                  create recipes, and take pictures for my personal brand -
                  Wildblend.co. My work as a recipe developer and nutritional
                  writer has taught me that more and more people realize that
                  what we put in our bodies has a direct effect on our health
                  but also on our success and happiness in life. I love to dig
                  deep and find out everything there is to know about foods,
                  ancestral diets, supplements, and training methods.

                  Apart from travelling my life is pretty much dedicated to
                  health and fitness; I'm a Paleo eater, crossfitter, health nut
                  and lover of all things untamed and natural. In the last year,
                  I taught myself the advantages of a Paleo/Bulletproof
                  lifestyle and ketogenic diet, the foundations of food
                  photography, social media marketing and how to become a health
                  food and fitness blogger. <a href="/">LetÂ´s get in touch!</a>
