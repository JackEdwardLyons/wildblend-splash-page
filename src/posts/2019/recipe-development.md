I love to collaborate with companies and brands on developing original recipes. I enjoy to come up with unique and healthy recipes which are easy to follow. I combine current food trends with an understanding of the target audience to develop recipes that look beautiful, taste fantastic and conform to any special dietary needs (gluten-free, Vegan, Paleo, AIP etc.). I can create anything from one shot for a PR campaign to a full cookbook or magazine feature.

Ready to collaborate? For my rates and any other ideas on partnerships, please contact me [via email](mailto:wildblendco@gmail.com) to obtain my media kit.
