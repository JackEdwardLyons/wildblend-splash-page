This is a cheesecake recipe with a perfect balance of flavors, making it a firm favourite with my family and friends. What elevates this brownie bottom raspberry cheesecake from tasty to super-delicious is the contrast of textures. If the layering of the baked brownie base with the creamy cheesecake layer isn’t delicious enough, the surprise of whole raspberries adds a fruity excitement.

The gooey, chocolaty brownie bottom takes just 5 minutes to mix and 25 minutes in a pre-heated oven. Check if it is ready with a toothpick – it should come out clean and feel firm. Let the brownie base cool in the baking dish. You’ll only remove it from the pan once all other layers have been assembled and the cheesecake is fully set. You can choose between a Vegan or Paleo brownie bottom depending on your dietary preference. I have added the Paleo-version to the recipe notes below.

Here’s the creative bit. It makes no real difference to the time it takes to mix the raspberry cheesecake layer, but you do have the option of choosing a one-colour cheesecake layer or a marble effect. If you find the thought of swirls enticing, divide the smooth and creamy cheesecake mix into 3 bowls. The 3 separate shades are created by adding different amounts of pitaya powder to each bowl. For the swirls of pink, pour the coloured cheesecake mix onto the cool brownie base in 3 layers. And then the magic: stir in the frozen raspberries.

The next step calls for a little patience – the cheesecake mixture must set properly before adding the jelly if you want it to lie on top. Your guests will thank you for taking the time because it transforms a two-layer dessert into a luxurious three-layer cheesecake.

The raspberry jelly takes some watching, because you don’t want it to catch. Gently bring it to the boil – you’ve waited this long, it would be a shame to rush now! Let it simmer for about five minutes, stirring constantly.
