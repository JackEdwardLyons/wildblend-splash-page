Christmas is a time of waste and excess. Each year, mountains of wrapping paper are going straight into the bin and leftover food platters are piling up in the fridge.

There is no longer a need for single-use sandwich bags. Stasher bags are a reusable storage solution ideal for the kitchen, travel, school lunches, baby items, phones, makeup and more.
