Delicate yet satisfying, these adaptogenic CBD chocolate bites will make anyone’s heart happy. The heavenly match of cacao and **CBD oil** makes this treat extra special. It’s hard to believe that the delicious creaminess is stress-reducing, hormone soothing and calming. These dessert squares may look too good to be _healthy_, but you’ll be delighted to know that this recipe is 100% **Vegan****\-friendly**. I've  also added a **Paleo** and **Keto-friendly** adaptation to the recipe notes.

This recipe is a beginner 'baker’s' delight. There are only **3 easy steps**, giving you the chance to catch your breath between each. Also, each layer uses the same method: put all the ingredients into the blender and mix. Even so, this is far from a boring dessert.  You’ll discover a layering of delicate flavours and textures.  The crunch of the base contrasts beautifully with the smooth creamy layers. The Maca powder in the base and the cream adds an unexpected mildly nutty taste with a hint of butterscotch.

Begin with the base layer. Make sure the press-in base is evenly distributed so that each bite gets an equal amount of the wholesome crust. I do this by pressing the sticky cookie dough into the baking dish with a drinking glass or straight-sided measuring cup. Cover the base evenly with the cream, and smooth with a spatula. Set aside in the freezer for 4-6 hours, and take a well-earned rest. The next day, combine the chocolate ingredients and pour over the set layers. For a sophisticated finish smooth with a spatula. Sprinkle with sea salt and hemp hearts.

Allow to set for half an hour in the fridge. Finally, cut into bite-size squares and serve, happy in the knowledge that this melt-in-the-mouth goodness will not only soothe and comfort, but the Maca and Ashwagandha will also empower your body to adapt to stress. This is an excellent dessert choice if you’re planning a dinner party because you can prepare most of it the day before. It will need 4-6 hours for the bottom 2 layers to set, and a further 30 minutes in the fridge once you’ve poured on the chocolate.
