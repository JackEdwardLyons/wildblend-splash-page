Fancy a wheat-free start to the day that's healthier and just as satisfying as classic oats? This Quinoa Coconut Porridge is a great alternative to breakfast oatmeal. Quinoa has quite the nutritional powerhouse reputation. Full of muscle building, metabolism boosting protein, itâ€™s also gluten free, low in calories and packed full of other essential vitamins and minerals. It's a weightloss-friendly alternative that you should add to your breakfast repertoire if you're looking for more healthy options.

Coconut milk adds a creamy tropical twist to this porridge and makes it suitable for vegans (or lactose intolerant). The fatty acids in coconut milk may aid weight loss, benefit your metabolism and heart health. Turmeric and Maca powder add plenty of flavour and immunity-boosting as well as anti-inflammatory properties to this power breakfast.

Every good porridge needs some form of liquid to bring all the flavors together. Coconut milk is my favourite but you can choose any other plant-based milk you like.

Replace coconut milk with any of these liquids:

- Almond milk
- Cashew milk
- Hemp milk
- Rice milk

Superfoods and spices can make a difference between a bland and a tasty porridge. Add any combination of your favorite seasonings (if you don't like turmeric and maca), or use these suggestions for extra flavour.

- Lucuma powder, dates and vanilla
- Cinnamon, cardamon, nutmeg, and ginger
- Cacao and peanut butter
- Cinnamon and raisins
- Cacao nibs
- Egg white (stir in while cooking for some extra protein)
- Stir through some veggies like grated zucchini, pumpkin or sweet potato puree

Add Extra Toppings:

- Walnuts
- Almonds
- Hazelnuts

- Hemp hearts
