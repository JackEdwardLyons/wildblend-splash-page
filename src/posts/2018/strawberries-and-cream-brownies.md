I love simple recipes. If you've been to this blog before, you've probably noticed that most of my recipes have 10 or less ingredients, and are blender or one-bowl recipes because I like to keep it simple. This Strawberries and Cream Brownie recipe is no exception. I used minimal ingredients while still keeping it gluten-free, dairy-free and flourless.

A lot of Paleo-friendly recipes use an intricate mix of different starches and nut flours to hold together. Fear not, these brownies are the complete opposite of complicated. I used applesauce and dates to make them extra fudgey and moist. Raw cacao powder adds antioxidants, iron and magnesium to this chocolately treat (Yes, chocolate is good for you).

The dairy-free cashew cream frosting is the icing on the cake ehm brownie. I dare you, not to eat it by itself because I certainly can't keep myself from licking the spoon. It's a spin off from my orange cashew glaze I used for my [orange and poppy seed bundt cake recipe](https://www.wildblend.co/orange-poppy-seed-bundt-cake/). The frosting comes together in a high-speed blender like a Vitamix. No other tools needed.

Most brownies I've tried in cafe's are a bit dry and powdery because they use too much flour. I like my brownies gooey, fudgey and moist. These Strawberries and Cream Brownies literally melt in your mouth. I promise, you don't even have to chew to enjoy them haha. If you love chocolate, you'll love them as much as I do.
