Inspired by my favourite childhood treat, these coconut caramel bars are a pink version of my blue Mermaid Bounty Bars. If you're following me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wildblend/), you'll know that I have a thing for [unicorn-coloured Bounty Bars](https://www.wildblend.co/unicorn-bounty-bars/). Like I said, Bounty was hands down my favourite candy growing up and these knock-off bars prove that chocolate and coconut are meant to go together.

To keep things healthy, I skipped condensed milk and tons of sugar and swapped it for better-for-you ingredients. To make the coconut filling, combine coconut cream, maple syrup, coconut butter, desiccated coconut and vanilla. The pink colour is achieved by adding a teaspoon of pink pitaya powder (I got mine [here](https://www.unicornsuperfoods.com/collections/superfood-collection/products/100-freeze-dried-pink-pitaya-powder)). Pitaya powder is 100% natural and a chemical-free alternative to conventional food colours.

The thick and gooey carmel layer comes together with almond butter, dates and almond milk. To finish it off, sweet coconut flakes and caramel get engulfed in rich dark chocolate. These are guaranteed to be a hit. Here's why:

- vegan
- gluten free
- dairy free
- naturally coloured
- antioxidant-rich
- paleo
- no bake

These pink coconut caramel bars are a great way to add some sweetness to your life while keeping it naturally healthy. Conventional candy bars are full of artificial ingredients that most of us can't even pronounce. Alternatively, you can DIY your favourite sweets and turn them into better-for-youÂ  treats that are guaranteed to satisfy all your cravings. Tip: Store your bars in an airtight-container in the freezer and enjoy them anytime you need a sweet treat!
