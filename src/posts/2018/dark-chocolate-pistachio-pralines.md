If you love pistachios then this recipe will quickly become a new favourite. I'm not exaggerating when I say that these Dark Chocolate Pistachio Pralines are absolutely divine—they are hands down better than any store-bought pralines I've ever tried. The best part? They’re made with a handful of simple, wholesome ingredients with no processed junk in sight.

While they’re inspired by the decadent chocolate pralines you see in shops, I nixed all the stabilizers, processed sugars, corn syrup and emulsifiers found in the store-bought version. These are essentially made with only five main ingredients and [Fit Mixes Chocolate Chia Protein Ball Mix](https://www.fit-mixes.com/products/chocolate-chia-protein-ball-mix) for the chocolate layer. A soft pistachio cream serves as a base to a  fluffy chocolate layer, then the whole thing gets drizzled in antioxidant-rich dark chocolate.
