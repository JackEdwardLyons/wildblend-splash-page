Craving donuts but want a healthy fix? By making a few tasty real food swaps, you can enjoy this healthy, Vegan-friendly version. These wholesome no-bake chocolate mint donuts are made with gluten-free oats, almonds, antioxidant-rich cacao and Medjool dates. They are just as nutritious as they are delicious and will satisfy any sweet craving.

These chocolate mint donuts take just as long to make as a trip to the doughnut shop, and prove far more nutritious. All you need is a [silicone donut mould](https://amzn.to/2Cxd09v) and a food processor, and you’re on your way. Start by combining all the dry ingredients in a food processor and pulse until evenly mixed. Then add the dates, vanilla, and peppermint essence and blend until you get a moist, thick dough that holds its shape. It should resemble a sticky cookie dough.

Once processed, press the dough into a silicone donut mould and place in the refrigerator to chill for 1 hour until set. In the meantime, prepare the glaze by blending all ingredients in a high-speed blender until smooth and glossy. If the glaze is too thin (runny), place it in the fridge for 30 minutes or until thickened before you start dipping the donuts.

These donuts are delicious enough to eat without frosting, but I recommend adding the glaze because it adds such a lovely splash of colour and additional mint flavour to the donuts. If you’re in a rush or prepping your donuts ahead of time, store the glaze and donuts in the refrigerator in separate containers. When you’re ready to indulge, dip the donuts in the glaze and decorate with (optional) melted chocolate. Store them in an airtight container in the fridge and enjoy with a cup of coffee or Matcha latte.
