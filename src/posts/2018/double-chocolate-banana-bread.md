The way I see it is, you have two options... You can use overripe bananas in a smoothie or you turn them into delicious banana bread. I definitely prefer option two as I'm constantly rummaging through the house for a healthy snack. Once it's past 3pm it's always good to have fiber-rich treats packed with healthy fats on hand. I literally have zero regrets when I nibble on a slice of this chocolate banana bread.

This recipe is a variation of my all-time-favourite Paleo almond flour banana bread. Tigernuts have become increasingly popular in the Paleo community and are a great alternative for anyone who is allergic to nuts. The name _tigernut_ is deceptive because they aren't actually nuts but small root vegetables from the tuber family. Tigernut flour is a great allergen-free alternative to gluten and nut floursplus it's packed with prebiotics which can improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation in the colon and help treat IBS.
