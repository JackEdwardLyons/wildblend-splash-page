Let's be honest, it doesn't matter whether you are kid or an adult, the chilled fruity appeal of homemade popsicles is universal. Ripe mangoes (here in Queensland) are naturally sweet enough to keep these icy poles **entirely sugar free** (yay!) and freeze dried dragon fruit powder, with its vivid pink colour adds a fun splash of colour to these treats.

Tigernuts are a new superfood on the gluten free market and believe it or not, tiger nuts aren’t nuts at all. They’re tiny starchy tubers with a mildly **sweet, nutty flavor** that grow under the ground. For someone who is allergic to nuts and gluten - tiger nuts are a really good choice. They're **crunchy**, naturally sweet and have a ton of nutritional benefits.
