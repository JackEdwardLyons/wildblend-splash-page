You've probably tried matcha lattes before but have you had matcha chocolate? No? That's ok because it's my first time also. Let's get into vibrant green, **superfood chocolate** bursting with 137 times the **antioxidants** of green tea!

In all honesty, I'm not a huge Matcha latte fan. Simply because I'm a coffee girl. Always have, always will be. Nothing can break the relationship that coffee and I have developed. However, a girl can learn. And a girl is open to new stuff. So, I decided to use the matcha powder I had at home to make chocolate instead.

All you need is 4 ingredients and a silicone chocolate mould—hearts, stars, circles, flowers, anything goes. It's best to use raw (pure, unheated) cacao butter for this recipe. You can find it in most health food stores, Source Bulk Foods, and online at [iherb](https://au.iherb.com/pr/Earth-Circle-Organics-Organic-Cacao-Butter-1-lb-453-4-g/76467). You probably already know that cacao tastes amazing (duh) but it's also one of the sexiest superfoods—loaded with tons of antioxidants, saturated fat (like coconut oil), and polyphenols.
