Avocados are my secret weapon. They are versatile yet often fly under the kitchen radar. Everyone can easily add it to their arsenal of Paleo and vegan friendly ingredients. I love the **nutty** flavour, **healthy fats** and **creamy** texture and literally eat them almost with every meal. So it's no surprise that my latest obsession is an Avocado Lime Cheesecake. You must try this one; it's a winnerâ€”I guarantee you'll love it.

This recipe best comes together with a high-speed food processor or blender (I used a Vitamix). Be sure to blend until the consistency of the cheesecake cream is super **silky** and **creamy**. You want to make sure there is no cashew chunks left. If you're working with a weaker device, turn it on and off, and blend multiple times until it reaches the desired consistency.

The benefits of avocado are endless. I could probably sing songs about it (if I could sing lol). All joking aside, avocados are really good for our lady parts. They are also incredibly **nutritious** and contain more **potassium** than a banana. Avocados are loaded with **fiber** and heart-healthy monounsaturated fatty acids (the good kind of fat). To sum it up, you can never eat enough avocados because they make EVERYTHING taste GREAT!
