You probably already know that I'm obsessed with magical food trends. Glitter, sparkles and pastels generally put a smile on everyone's face. So, I couldn't help but make these **ocean-coloured** Mermaid chocolate bars. If you want to create some magic yourself, be sure to get your hands on some [Blue Majik](https://www.e3live.com.au/All-Products/Blue-Majik-FP-80-Powder.aspx) aka blue algae with superpowers.

Now, you don't have to throw a Mermaid party to get excited about these Ariel-inspired treats. As if homemade, **guilt-free** Bounty Bars weren't already good enough, these are also topped with magical blue moon dust aka **edible glitter**. Be sure to have your phone ready to take a picture and post it on Instagram (#mermaidfood).

Life might not be all rainbows and unicorns once you put these in your mouth but it's a pretty sparkling experience to eat them. Better make a double batch because everyone will want to be part of this Mermaid party. Who would have thought healthy can look so darn beautiful, huh?!
