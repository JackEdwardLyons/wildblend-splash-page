Not only are **homemade** Bounty Bars absolutely delicious but these are also (almost) too pretty to eat (Insta-alert)! So, before your boyfriend eats them all at once, make sure to take a picture and post it to Instagram (**#unicornfood**).

Most unicorn foods you see on Instagram are created with artificial colouring and flavoring. These colourful bounties get their pastel colour from naturally nourishing sources including turmeric, pitaya powder and butterfly pea powder—they'll definitely help generate some serious double tapping action.
