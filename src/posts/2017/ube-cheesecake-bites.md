A few months back, I was first introduced to ube desserts in the United States and was immediately fascinated. The colour and texture of these sweet treats was too good to be "natural". Can donuts and ice creams made of a starchy tuber really be this good? I was determined to get my hands on this intriguing vegetable and try for myself. The result are these whimsical white chocolate and ube cheesecakes bites. Take a bite, they will definitely not disappoint.

## What is Ube?

Let's talk about ube (oo-beh) - also known as purple yam. The starchy root vegetable often used in Filipino cuisine has recently gained popularity on Instagram. Talk about a photogenic tuber! Ube has a sublime deep purple colour and tastes pretty much like sweet potato. It's **sweet nutty flavour** with a hint of vanilla makes it ideal for dessert and the purple hue adds fantastic colour to anything.

In the Philippines ube is most commonly used to make everything from ice cream, to cheesecakes, to donuts, to flan and filled cream puffs. It can be difficult to find fresh (depending where you live, mostly at Asian supermarkets) but can also be bought in dehydrated powder form online ([here](https://www.ebay.com.au/i/152781315751?chn=ps)). I prefer fresh ube but powder can sometimes be easier to add to desserts.

If you follow me on Instagram, you might already know that I'm obsessed with colourful food. So it's not really a surprise that ube has taken my heart by storm: I'm sure once you've tried it, you'll love t as much as I do.

These starchy little tubers are full of goodness:

- antioxidant-rich
- vitamin C
- vitamin A
- vitamin E
- potassium
- lots of fiber
- hazelnutty vanilla flavour

I love adding natural colour to my desserts and ube has definitely caught my attention. So stay tuned, there is a ton of other ube recipes to come.
