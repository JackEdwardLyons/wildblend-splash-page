Step aside matcha -- there is a new superfood in town. Turmeric is currently taking social media by storm. The humble spice has transformed everything, from non-coffee lattes and no-bake brownies into anti-inflammatory super foods.

You'll most often find turmeric added to curries but I love adding it to both savoury as well as sweet dishes to add some hearty depth and vibrant colour. Like ginger, turmeric is a root with a bright orange, slightly bitter flesh. You can add fresh turmeric root to your juices or create potent **anti-cold** remedies with it. If you do a quick google search, you'll discover the endless list of benefits turmeric and it's active ingredient curcumin have to offer. The only downside to using it are stubborn stains (my yellow-stained tea towels are proof!). However, you can find ways to get rid those stains here.

This grain-free, **low-carb** and **veggie-packed** flatbread has become a family favourite in my house. We make it all the time, add different flavours to it and can never have enough of it stored in the freezer. It's a no-fuss recipe that you can literally whip up in a matter of 15 minutes. I haven't met a single person who isn't immediately hooked and loves the simplicity of this recipe.

Will it hold up as a sandwich, you ask? Definitely! It's a tested no-crumb bread alternative for those who love a good sandwich but don't like store-bought Paleo breads. I personally stay away from **gluten-free** bread alternatives because they are usually on the carb-heavy side and contain a multitude of additives and ingredients my sensitive tummy can't stomach. This is a minimal ingredient solution that even the pickiest of eaters will enjoy.

If you (or your kids) don't like turmeric—fine, leave it out. It's an optional ingredient that's not really necessary for the recipe. As for other flavour additions, we love **nutritional yeast** because it adds a nutty and cheesy flavour to the bread. But feel free to be creative with flavours, the options are endless. Here are some ideas for extra add-ins:

- garlic
- chili flakes
- herbs such as rosemary, chives, or basil
- dried tomato
- olives
- pepper flakes

## Golden Cauliflower Flatbread with Healing Turmeric

This grain-free, low-carb and veggie-packed flatbread has become a family favourite in my house

- **Author:** Zoe
- **Prep Time:** 10 mins
- **Cook Time:** 30 mins
- **Total Time:** 40 mins
- **Yield:** 8 slices 1x

### Ingredients

Scale 1x2x3x

- 2 cups raw riced cauliflower
- 4 eggs
- 1 cup LSA\*
- 3 t turmeric powder
- Pinch of black pepper
- ½ t sea salt
- 2 Tbsp nutritional yeast flakes\*\*

### Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 175°C (350°F). Line a baking tray with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, mix all ingredients and combine well with a spoon.
3. Transfer mixture to the lined baking tray and evenly press it into a rectangle. Make sure the layer is about ½-centimeter (.2 inches) thick.
4. Bake at 175°C for 30 minutes, or until golden.
5. Once baked, cool completely and gently peel the parchment paper from the flatbread.
6. Slice flatbread into 8 pieces.
7. Store bread in a container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

### Notes

**Tip:** This bread will freeze well when sliced up stored in an airtight container. I put baking/wax paper between the slices to keep them from sticking together.

\* LSA is a mix made from ground flax seed, sunflower seeds and almonds.

\*\* Nutritional yeast cannot be substituted with activated yeast, baking powder or brewers yeast. It’s mainly added for flavour, as it adds a cheesy and nutty taste to the bread.
