These burger buns are not just gluten-free, they're 100% Paleo-friendly. This recipe replaces traditional gluten-free flour for riced cauliflower and almond meal.  The result is a **less calorie-dense** fluffy bun that is **chock-full with fiber** and nutrients. Overall, eating less grains (even if you're not a Celiac) will definitely benefit your health. Fewer grains means fewer calories, fewer blood-sugar-spikes and **less inflammation**. Win win!

In this new recipe, cauliflower is teamed with **vitamin C-rich** and **immunity-boosting** beet powder, which adds the beautiful bright red hue to the buns.
