But do you also check the ingredients of your skincare? And even if you do, can you make sense of the information contained on a cosmetic ingredient list? Deciphering an ingredient list isn’t easy, especially if you don’t have a background in cosmetic science.

## Which nasties are hiding in your beauty products?

I was oblivious to the toxic ingredients that were hiding in my skincare products up until a couple years ago, when I started cleaning up my diet. My ‘clean eating’ journey lead me to discovering other aspects of health. I quickly learnt that true and complete health is achieved my finding balance in all aspects of our lives. I started researching about clean skincare and ended up throwing 90% of my beauty and makeup products in the bin.

## What does my personal toxin-free skin routine look like?

Since then, I’m trying to leave my skin alone – for the most part – and pamper it when necessary with nourishing oils, hydrating mists and natural essences. When I discovered Natalie, I was immediately fascinated by her natural approach to skincare and extensive knowledge about all things toxin free. [KINDRED TOXIN FREE](https://www.kindredtoxinfreefacials.com.au/) takes facials to the next level. Natalie has created rituals that go beyond traditional beauty.

## What is a toxin-free facial?

Natalie's 60-minutes glow rituals include:

\+ either diamond head microdermabrasion or enzyme therapy + rose quartz facial massage + grounding meditation + energy clearing and crystal mist + smudging + arm, hand, face, shoulder and scalp massage + superfood chocolate and kombucha shot in the end + time to de-stress and re-focus

You’ll walk out of Natalie’s studio with glowing skin and a radiant heart.
