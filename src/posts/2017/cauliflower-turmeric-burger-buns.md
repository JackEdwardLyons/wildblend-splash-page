This **veggie-packed** alternative to traditional burger buns is totally **flour-free** and surprisingly light and **fluffy**. You can pack it with your favourite fillings, take it to work or enjoy it for lunch.

Cauliflower is a versatile ingredient in **gluten-free** baking and often makes an appearance in my kitchen due to its bland flavour. It turns everything in a healthy meal, adds a punch of **Vitamin-C** and **fiber**, and is teamed with anti-inflammatory and **immunity-boosting turmeric** in these buns. We store all our vegetables in a [Swag Bag](https://t.cfjump.com/52650/t/14846?Url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.biome.com.au%2freduce-and-reuse%2f17237-the-swag-produce-storage-bag-individual-small.html) to keep them fresh and make them last longer in the fridge.

The best part, you can actually pick these buns up like a real hamburger. They are thicker, sturdier and breadier than most gluten-free buns and hold together perfectly.

I love this recipe so much and I know you will too. It's:

- paleo
- gluten-free
- grain-free
- anti-inflammatory
- low-carb
- fiber-rich

With just a handful of ingredients, this recipe comes together in no time and can easily become part of your weekly food prep. As far as seasoning goes, there are no limits to your creativity. I love **turmeric** and **nutritional yeast** to add some **cheesy flavour** but you can go whatever floats your boat.
