Cauliflower oatmeal uses cauliflower rice in place of oats to create a creamy and delicious breakfast alternative for those who can't eat oats (like me).

Sounds weird? No, trust me. It actually tastes really good because cauliflower is pretty bland in taste and takes on the flavour of whatever you add to it. I added cinnamon, lucuma powder, a teaspoon of maple, shredded coconut, and almond butter to make it extra creamy. The best part, this unique twist on oatmeal is an easy way to eat vegetables for breakfast - without even noticing.

I'm sensitive to oats, even the gluten-free kind gives me serious bloat. This veggie-packed version makes for a great replacement for overnight oats. Just like oatmeal, it gets really creamy overall but still maintains a nice little crunch to it. You can eat it cold straight from the fridge or warmed up on chilly winter mornings.

My favourite toppings are cacao nibs, toasted coconut flakes, chia seeds, fresh fruit, activated nuts, or hemp hearts. Feel free to get creative with your flavour combinations, the sky is the limit. Here are a few ideas:

- pear, cinnamon and raisins
- apple, maple and pecans
- coconut milk, banana and vanilla

Nut butters such as almond, hazelnut or cashew will add extra creaminess to your oatmeal â€“ just make sure you stir vigorously to dissolve any clumps. Superfood seeds can add some extra crunch to the creamy oatmeal. Combine the riced cauliflower with almond, coconut, rice or soy milk - whatever plant-based milk tickles your fancy.
