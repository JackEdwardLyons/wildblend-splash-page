With Easter looming around the corner I've been looking for healthy, clean-eating alternatives to sugar-laden chocolate bunnies and pralines. Even organic chocolate eggs promoted at my local health food store are not up to my standard of a guilt-free treat.

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE chocolate but I don't want the corn syrup, lecithin, Soy and milk solid it usually comes with. So, these Avocado Coconut truffles coated in raw chocolate are my healthy Easter basket alternative.

Each ingredient in these no-bake truffles bring their own set of **nutritional benefits**. Raw cacao packs 40 times the **antioxidants** of blueberries and is the highest plant-based source of iron. Avocado provides a dose of **healthy fats**, while coconut nourishes you with energy to get you through the day.
