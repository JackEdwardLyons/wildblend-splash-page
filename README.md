**Using Emotion & Tailwind**

With the CSS utility library Tailwind you can quickly add styles, even adding responsive styles for different screen sizes without having to write any css. Emotion allows you to name and style elements within your js files.

```JSX
/*
  remember to import styled from 'emotion'
  creating a styled div, centring children using flex
*/

const StyledDiv = styled.div`
  ${tw`flex justify-center items-center`}
`

return (
  <StyledDiv>
    <p>I'm centred</p>
    <p>Me too!</p>
  </StyledDiv>
);
```

The [tailwind website](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/) has great documentation to get you started.

**Customisation**

- [Tailwind config](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration). Open up the tailwind.js file to set your own project preferences & requirements, such as break-points, colors, and fonts

- Edit the global styles (`src/styles/global.js`) which is injected into every page, or remove entirely

- A layout component (`src/components/elements/layout.js`) is used for wrapping every page, setting a default layout and importing the template's Open Sans font

- This template uses the plugin [gatsby-plugin-subfont](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-subfont#readme) together with [typefaces](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/typefaces/blob/master/README.md) to optimise font delivery. Changing font(s) simply requires installing your favourite typeface-font and importing into layout.js, or removing it altogether. Remember to add your font(s) into the tailwind.js config, into either the fonts sans/serif array, in order to use it with tailwind

- SEO component, taken from [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), allowing you to add your meta/descriptions/title's

- Favicon. Auto-generated from [gatsby-plugin-manifest](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-manifest#readme) set in `gatsby-config.js`. Replace the current favicon (`src/images/icon/logo.png`) with your own 512x512 icon

- Analytics. Add your google analytics id into the `gatsby-config.js` file to get started
